## üß™ Testing

### Local Testing

   ```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. **Start Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Iframe Embedding**:
   Visit `http://localhost:3000/test-embed` to test the app in various iframe configurations.

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Iframe Detection**: App correctly identifies when embedded
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop, tablet, and mobile iframe sizes

- [ ] **Webhooks**: Stripe and Whop webhooks are received and processed
- [ ] **Multi-tenancy**: Data is properly scoped by company

### Production Testing

1. **Create Test Community**: Set up a Whop community for testing
2. **Install App**: Install ChargeChase from the Whop app store
3. **Connect Stripe**: Test the Stripe Connect flow
4. **Simulate Payment Failure**: Create test scenarios with failed payments
5. **Verify Recovery**: Confirm that dunning emails are sent and payments recovered
6. **Check Billing**: Ensure transaction fees are properly charged

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Installation Rate**: Number of communities installing the app
- **Connection Rate**: Percentage of installs that connect Stripe accounts
- **Recovery Rate**: Percentage of failed payments successfully recovered
- **Revenue**: Total transaction fees collected
- **Churn**: Communities that uninstall the app

### Logging
- All API requests are logged with Whop company context
- Payment recovery events are tracked in `RecoveryEvent` model
- Transaction fees are logged for accounting purposes

## üîß Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Monitor Webhook Health**: Ensure Stripe and Whop webhooks are processing
2. **Process Batch Fees**: Run monthly billing for accumulated transaction fees
3. **Update Dependencies**: Keep Whop SDK and other packages updated
4. **Review Analytics**: Monitor app performance and user engagement

### Scaling Considerations
- **Database**: Consider read replicas for high-traffic communities
- **Background Jobs**: Implement Redis/Celery for processing dunning sequences
- **CDN**: Use CloudFront or similar for static assets
- **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for failed payments, webhook issues, etc.
