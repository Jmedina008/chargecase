🧵 How to recover thousands in failed payments (5 min read)

1/ Every creator loses 8-15% of revenue to failed payments

But 95% never follow up systematically 

Here's how to automate payment recovery:

2/ The problem is bigger than you think:

If you make $10k/month:
→ $1,500 fails every month
→ Only 2% gets recovered manually
→ You're losing $1,470 forever

That's $17,640 per year 💸

3/ Solution: Automated dunning sequences

When a payment fails:
→ Send branded recovery email (Day 1)
→ Follow up with portal link (Day 3)  
→ Final notice with urgency (Day 7)
→ 78% recovery rate on average

4/ [Tool]: ChargeChase does this automatically

→ 2-minute Stripe integration
→ Branded emails with your colors
→ Secure Stripe billing portals
→ 2.9% fee only on recoveries

5/ Results from real creators:

"$3,200 recovered in month 1" - Sarah
"Paid for itself in week 2" - Mike  
"Set it and forget it" - Jessica

6/ Want to try it?

→ Install on Whop (free)
→ Connect Stripe (2 minutes)
→ Start recovering revenue today
