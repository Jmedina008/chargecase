## Message Templates (Copy/Paste Ready)

### Template 1: Course Creators
```
Hey [Name]! ðŸ‘‹

Noticed you've got [course name] doing great numbers. Quick question - 

How much monthly revenue do you lose to failed payments? 

Most course creators lose 8-15% ($2-5K+) and never follow up systematically.

I built ChargeChase to fix this - it automatically recovers failed payments with branded dunning emails. One creator recovered $3,200 in month 1.

Worth a quick demo? Takes 2 mins to see if it's a fit ðŸ“ˆ

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. - Only pay 2.9% on money we actually recover. No upfront costs.
```

### Template 2: Community Builders
```
Hi [Name]!

Love what you've built with [community name] - [specific compliment about their community].

Quick question: What % of your members churn due to failed payments vs intentional cancellation?

Most community owners lose 10-15% to payment failures alone. That's hundreds of lost subscribers monthly.

ChargeChase automatically sends branded recovery emails when payments fail. We've helped creators recover 78% of failed payments on average.

Mind if I show you a quick 2-min demo of how it works?

Best,
[Your name]

Zero upfront cost - only 2.9% fee on successful recoveries.
