## üì± DM Templates (100/day strategy)

### Template 1: Course Creators
```
Hey [Name]! üëã

Noticed you've got [course name] doing great numbers. Quick question - 

How much monthly revenue do you lose to failed payments? 

Most course creators lose 8-15% ($2-5K+) and never follow up systematically.

I built ChargeChase to fix this - it automatically recovers failed payments with branded dunning emails. One creator recovered $3,200 in month 1.

Worth a quick demo? Takes 2 mins to see if it's a fit üìà

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. - Only pay 2.9% on money we actually recover. No upfront costs.
```

### Template 2: Membership Communities
```
Hi [Name]!

Love what you've built with [community name] - [specific compliment about their community].

Quick question: What % of your members churn due to failed payments vs intentional cancellation?

Most community owners lose 10-15% to payment failures alone. That's hundreds of lost subscribers monthly.

ChargeChase automatically sends branded recovery emails when payments fail. We've helped creators recover 78% of failed payments on average.

Mind if I show you a quick 2-min demo of how it works?

Best,
[Your name]

Zero upfront cost - only 2.9% fee on successful recoveries.
```

### Template 3: SaaS Founders
```
Hey [Name],

Saw [tool name] on Product Hunt - congrats on the launch! üöÄ

Quick question about your Stripe dashboard - what's your involuntary churn rate from failed payments?

Most SaaS tools lose 5-12% MRR monthly to payment failures that never get properly followed up on.

Built ChargeChase specifically for this - automated dunning sequences that recover 70-80% of failed payments.

Worth showing you how [similar SaaS] recovered $4,200 last month?

2-min demo available anytime üìä

[Your name]

P.S. - Performance-based pricing: only pay when we recover revenue
```

### Template 4: Coaches & Consultants  
```
Hi [Name]! 

Really enjoyed your recent post about [specific content]. Great insights on [topic].

Random question - do you ever have clients whose payments fail mid-program?

Most coaches lose 10-20% of program revenue to payment issues and spend hours chasing manual follow-ups.

ChargeChase automates this entirely - branded recovery emails, secure payment portals, 78% average recovery rate.

One coach recovered $2,800 in failed payments in 30 days with zero manual work.

Worth a quick demo? Happy to show you exactly how it works üí∞

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Follow-up Template (Day 3)
```
Hey [Name],

Following up on my message about payment recovery for [their business type].

Just had another creator recover $1,900 this week using ChargeChase.

The setup is literally 2 minutes:
1. Install app on Whop
2. Connect Stripe 
3. Start recovering failed payments automatically

No monthly fees, no contracts - just pay 2.9% on money we actually recover.

Worth 5 minutes to see if it makes sense for [their business]?

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. - [Add specific result/testimonial relevant to their niche]
```
